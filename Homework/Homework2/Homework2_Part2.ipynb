One notable difference is that for X2, x7 had a p-value of 0.042 (which is less than 0.05). It makes sense that x1 through x5 are signifciant since y is built on these first 5 columns (with a little added noise). Moreover, building a multilinear regression with just these columns yeilds a very high R<sup>2</sup> and a lower AIC/BIC (shown below). This suggests that x7 is significant for X2 purely out of luck in the random numbers chosen. Furthermore, by removing all columns that are not significant in X2 one by one, x7 is shown to not be significant with a p-value of 0.059 (also shown below). Lastly, since the AIC and BIC were lowered it is reasonable to conclude that columns x6 through x10 are actually overfitting the model since the data set is multicolinear.\n","\n","X3 & X4: Again, most of the variables performed very similarily in regards to their significance (x2 through x5 were all significant for both).

In turn, this overfits the model making it bad at predicting future data. Using the VIF values, it was found that X1, X3, X4, X5, and X7 did not contribute to multicollinearity (VIF values were all below 5). When running linear regression using every value versus just the 5 that were linearly independent, they performed fairly close. The most notable difference however is that all the p-values (minus the constant) were significant for the processed dataset unlike the original dataset. However, while it may appear that the results are comparable, the processed data will perform much better when given new data and as such is the better model."]}]}
